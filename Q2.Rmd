Q2.
```{r}
#a The amount fo annual loan repayment for Scott 
Scottloan=annualrep
Scottloan
```

```{r}
#b To find the term of loan repayment with offset account, we first create a function with the variable 'n' and then use the uniroot function to solve for the n term for loan repayment.
loan=600000
int=0.035
offsetacc=100000
loanrepay=annualrep+(offsetacc*int)
loanrepay
```

```{r}
#c
f=function(n){
  repayment=c(rep(loanrepay,30))
  v=1/(1.035)^n
  PV=sum(repayment*v)
  return(500000-PV)
}
# The uniroot calculates n as 22 years. 
uniroot(f,c(0,30))
```

```{r}
#d To find the final smaller amount or payment, we find the balance of loan at 22nd payment, which is found by deducting the discounted loan repayment from accummulated loan of $600000. Then we accummulate further the balance of loan by one year and then get the final payment by taking away the amount in offset account and final interest from the offset account. 
AB22=600000*(1.035)^22-loanrepay*(((1.035^22)-1)/0.035)
AB23=AB22*1.035
lastpay=AB23-3500-100000
lastpay
```
