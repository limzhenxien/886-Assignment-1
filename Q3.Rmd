Q3.
```{r}
#a The commossion is simply 1000 annually accummulated with interest of 3.5%.
commission=(1000*((1-(1/1.035)^30)/(1-(1.035)^(-1))))*(1.035^(-1))
commission
```

```{r}
#b
## Lower rate than 3.5%, as the present value of the loan plus commission has increased.
```

```{r}
#c We create another function with variable 'i' to be solved by the uniroot function.
q=function(i){
  payments=c(rep(annualrep,30))
  v=1/(1+i)^(1:30)
  PV=sum(payments*v)
  return(PV-commission-600000)
}
# Uniroot gives the results of interest rate of about 3.26%.
uniroot(q,c(0,0.035))
```

```{r}
#d Then using the solved interest rate of 3.26%, we can find the adjusted annual repayment for Bill.
adjustedrepay=600000/((1-(1/1.0326028)^30)/0.0326028)
adjustedrepay
```
